## Decentralized Applications

### Lesson 3: Browser Storage

*Doug Hoyte, June 2019*

[https://is.gd/blockchaindapps](https://is.gd/blockchaindapps)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Lesson Topics

* Browser storage options
* Database fundamentals
* IndexedDB

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Server-side storage

<img src="web-dbs1.svg" style="background-color: white" />

* Centralized: All data is stored on remote server
* Users can easily share data

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Client-side storage

<img src="web-dbs2.svg" style="background-color: white" />

* Decentralized: Users store their own data, locally
* Sharing data is more difficult

</script></section>






<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Same origin policy

* Very important web security mechanism
* Websites can only read data that they wrote, not data of other sites:
  * `funny-cat-pictures.com` can't read cookies set by `bank-of-america.com`
* website consists of:
  * URL scheme (http/https)
  * domain (bank-of-america.com)
  * port (defaults to 80/443)

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Sandboxes

<img src="sandbox.svg" style="background-color: white" />

* As well as being isolated from each-other, websites cannot directly access computer resources
* You can't open or save a file from a web-browser
* Need to use other interfaces

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cookies

* The oldest type of browser storage
* Managed at the HTTP-level (or, optionally, with javascript)
* Usually for storing very small items like **session tokens**

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Set-Cookie header

<img src="cookies.png" width="600px" />

* Server sends `Set-Cookie` header on a response
* Client sends this cookie with all future requests to this server

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cookie security flags

* `Secure` - This cookie is only sent over `https://` requests, not `http://`
  * Cookies can't be intercepted at network level
* `HttpOnly` - This cookie cannot be accessed by javascript
  * XSS attacks can't download session tokens

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cookies pros/cons

* Pro: supported by all browsers
* Pro: can be isolated from javascript, making XSS attacks harder
* Con: Only small values (4096 byte limit)
* Con: Sent to server on every HTTP request, wastes bandwidth

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## WebSQL (deprecated)

* Many browsers provided access to an SQLite DB for every website
* Don't use this
  * It is being removed from browsers
  * Wasn't a good idea to standardize on SQLite quirks

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## localStorage

* `localStorage.setItem(key, value)`
  * Stores `value` into browser storage space as `key` entry
  * Both `value` and `key` must be strings
* `value = localStorage.getItem(key)`
  * Retrieves the value of `key` entry
* `localStorage.clear()`
  * Deletes all keys from storage space

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## sessionStorage

* Works the same as `localStorage` except for data life-time
* `localStorage` exists until data is deleted, even if browser restarted or computer rebooted
* `sessionStorage` goes away when browser is restarted, but stays across page reloads

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Sychronous writes

    localStorage.setItem(key, value);

* When `localStorage.setItem()` returns, data is guaranteed to be saved to disk
* So, user is free to close page
* Problem: While `setItem` is running, javascript and whole page is frozen!
  * Bad user experience
  * Not fixable with `localStorage` API

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## IndexedDB

* The most powerful storage option for browsers
* `localStorage` is OK for small items like user preferences
* But IndexedDB is best for anything larger/more complex
  * More later...

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Tracking

* Browser storage has a dark-side
* Often used for tracking users
* Even when you try to delete all storage for a website, you might not get them all
  * [Evercookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercookie)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Exercise: localStorage

1. Open the browser console (control-shift-i)
1. Set the key `"a"` to `"hello"`
1. Reload the browser
  * Retrieve the key `"a"` to verify it's still there
1. Go to a different website
  * Retrieve the key `"a"`
    * Is it gone? Why not?

</script></section>



<section>

<p data-markdown>
## Exercise: devtools
</p>

<div class="left">
    <img src="devtools.png" style="float: left; border:0px; background-color: white" />
</div>

<div class="right"><p data-markdown>
* Open devtools (control-shift-i) and find the Applications tab
* Find your localStorage entry. Look at other sites: what are they storing on your browser?
</p></div>

</section>

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Database interfaces

* SQL: Structured Query Language
      SELECT * FROM table WHERE ...
  * Standard language for interacting with DBs

* Key-value stores
      set(key, value)
  * More primitive, sometimes more flexible, sometimes more efficient
  * SQL DBs are built on KV stores

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Primary keys

<pre>
{
  <span class="highlight">id: 82371</span>,
  relationship: "customer",
  name: "John Smith",
  address: "123 Main St."
}
</pre>

* Most data-bases require every record to have a unique ID
  * Unique means no other record can have the same ID

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## DB Normalization

<pre>
{                             {
  id: 1992752,                  id: 1992773,
  orderAmount: "$100",          orderAmount: "$50",
  name: "John Smith",           name: "John Smith",
  address: "123 Main St."       address: "123 Main St."
}                             }
</pre>

* Let's say we have a table of "orders", and we copy the important bits of the customer record into it
  * What if you need to update customer address?
* Normalization: Data should only exist in one place
  * Use **foreign keys**

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Foreign keys

<pre>
{                                {
  id: 82371,                       id: 1992752,
  relationship: "customer",        orderAmount: "$100",
  name: "John Smith",              <span class="highlight">customerId: 82371</span>
  address: "123 Main St."        }
}                                {
                                   id: 1992773,
                                   orderAmount: "$50",
                                   <span class="highlight">customerId: 82371</span>
                                 }
</pre>

* A link from one table to another
  * Refer to entries in other tables by their primary keys

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## De-Normalization

* Sometimes DB designers deliberately choose to keep multiple copies of same data
  * Usually for efficiency reasons
    * [Locality of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference): It's cheap to access something nearby something you've already accessed
  * This is **caching** so be careful
    * "There are only two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## ACID

* Properties we want from our DBs
  * Atomic
  * Consistent
  * Isolated
  * Durable

</script></section>


<style>
pre.acid {
  font-size: 115%;
}
</style>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Bank transfer

* Suppose we want to transfer $100 from A to B
* This requires 2 DB operations:

<pre class="acid">
  <span>A -= $100</span>
  <span>B += $100</span>
</pre>

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Atomic

* What if computer crashes between operations?
* Does the $100 just disappear?

<pre class="acid">  
  <span>A -= $100</span>
  <span style="color:red">**COMPUTER CRASH**</span>
  <span>B += $100</span>
</pre>

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Consistent

* What if there is a bug that creates money out of nowhere?

<pre class="acid">
  <span>A -= $100</span>
  <span>B += $<span style="color:red">101</span></span>
</pre>

* You can create consistency checks in DBs by using **constraints**

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Isolated

* If somebody else is accessing the DB at the same time you are, they could partial results of operations
* This would report $100 being missing:

<pre class="acid">
Time  You         Reporting script
  |   <span>A -= $100</span>
  |               <span>let total = A + B</span>
  |   <span>B += $100</span>
  V
</pre>

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Durable

* After performing your operations, there should be a guarantee that they won't be lost:

<pre class="acid">
<span>A -= $100</span>
<span>B += $100</span>
print "OK, transfer complete!"
<span style="color:red">**COMPUTER CRASH BEFORE DATA WRITTEN**</span>
</pre>

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solution: Transactions

* Many databases require you to wrap your operations in **transactions**
* Before doing your operations you **begin** a transaction
* When done your operations, you **commit** your transaction

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Transactions: ACID

* **Atomic**: Either all your operations will go through, or none of them will
* **Consistent**: DB checks constraints as you go, or when you commit (deferred)
* **Isolated**: Other transactions will not see your partial operations
* **Durable**: After a successful commit, guaranteed to be written to disk

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Blockchain vs. DB transactions

* Same name: not a coincidence
* Remember, a blockchain *is* a DB
* Blockchain transactions guarantee ACID
  * Atomic: Transaction cannot be "half applied"
  * Consistent: You can't steal/counterfeit money
  * Isolated: Only one is executed at a time
  * Durable: Permanently saved on chain (except for re-orgs)

</script></section>









<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## How are transactions implemented?

* Two main strategies:
  * Locking
    * Traditional way: conceptually simpler
  * Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) 
    * Clients spend less time waiting
    * Can use more memory than locking

</script></section>


<section>

<p data-markdown>
## Locking
</p>

<div class="left">
    <img src="locking.svg" style="float: left; border:0px; background-color: white" />
</div>

<div class="right"><p data-markdown>
* Only one process can access pages that have been modified (or read!)
* Two-phase locking: First you acquire locks, then you release
</p></div>

</section>


<section>

<p data-markdown>
## MVCC
</p>

<div class="left">
    <img src="mvcc.svg" style="float: left; border:0px; background-color: white" />
</div>

<div class="right"><p data-markdown>
* Any modifications create their own version of the DB (but mostly shared, so efficient)
* Writers don't block readers, readers don't block anybody
</p></div>

</section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Repeatable Reads

* Even read-only groups of operations must be in transactions
* In MVCC, transactions see "snapshots" of the DB: does not change throughout the transaction

<pre class="acid">
<span>print A -> $500</span>
                   <span style="color:red">print A -> $500</span>
                   <span style="color:red">A -= $100</span>
                   <span style="color:red">print A -> $400</span>
<span>print A -> $500</span>
</pre>

</script></section>






<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Only strings?

* Why can `localStorage` only store strings?
* Suppose it could store anything:
  * What if you stored something like a websocket connection
  * Then rebooted your computer
  * What would it mean to retrieve this old websocket connection?

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Serialization

* Most network protocols, key-value DBs, etc, require you to convert your complex data-structures into strings
* This is called serialization
  * Synonyms: encoding, marhsalling, pickling
* Most common serialization format in browsers:
  * JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## JSON in browser

* Originally, JSON was decoded like this:

      eval("(" + json + ")")

* But what if a hacker passes this "JSON" to you:

      function(){alert('XSS hack')}()

* Never use `eval`

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Java struts bug

* The Java Struts library had a [deserialization bug](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-5638/)
  * Basically the same as `eval` issue, but server-side with xml and java
* Cause of famous equifax data breach
* Wasn't the first, won't be the last
* Never trust input from users!

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## JSON in browser, improved

* Modern browsers have safe, built-in JSON routines
* Encode JSON:

      let json = JSON.stringify(obj);

* Decode JSON:

      let obj = JSON.parse(json);

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## JSON problem: redundancy

      [
          { "firstName": "Alice" },
          { "firstName": "Bob" },
          { "firstName": "Carol" },
          { "firstName": "Danny" }
      ]

* `"firstName"` repeated many times
* This can be inefficient
  * But compression helps a lot with this

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## JSON problem: not seekable

* Most JSON parsers require you parse the entire string to read anything

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Smith","isAlive":true,"age":27,"address":{"streetAddress":"21 2nd Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","postalCode":"10021-3100"},"phoneNumbers":[{"type":"home","number":<span class="highlight">"212 555-1234"</span>},{"type":"office","number":"646 555-4567"},{"type":"mobile","number":"123 456-7890"}],"children":[],"spouse":null}
</pre>

* What if all you want is one phone number?

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Alternative serializations

* MessagePack, CBOR
  * "binary" JSON
  * Harder to read, but smaller and faster to encode/parse
* Thrift, Protocol buffers
  * Binary (solves redundancy)
  * Can be parsed much faster than JSON, but still requires parsing whole value
* Flat buffers, Cap'n proto
  * Seekable

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Indices (indexes)

    users.put("Smith",   { firstName: "John", age: 21 });
    users.put("Taylor",  { firstName: "Dona", age: 47 });
    users.put("Jackson", { firstName: "Mike", age: 34 });

* In the above data-set, you can quickly look-up by last name (the key)
* But if you want to look up by `firstName`, you have to loop over all the records

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Add an index

    users.put("Smith",   { firstName: "John", age: 21 });
    users.put("Taylor",  { firstName: "Dona", age: 47 });
    users.put("Jackson", { firstName: "Mike", age: 34 });
    firstNameIndex.put("John", "Smith");
    firstNameIndex.put("Dona", "Taylor");
    firstNameIndex.put("Mike", "Jackson");

* Now, to lookup user with firstName `Dona`:
      let lastName = firstNameIndex.get("Dona");
      let user = users.get(lastName);

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Binary search

<img src="binary-search.svg" style="background-color: white" />

* It's easy to find an element in a sorted array
* `O(log(n))` steps required

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## How an index works

<img src="binary-search-index.svg" style="background-color: white" />

* An index is just another "mini DB" where each record points to the "main DB"
* Index keys are from the values of the main DB

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Indices: More

* You can have many indices for a single DB
* Indices usually support duplicate records (many people can have same first name)
  * But not always: sometimes you want to ensure a **unique** index (student ID number)
* Some values can be left out of a **partial** index (only active students)

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cursors

<img src="cursor.svg" style="background-color: white" />

* A cursor is a pointer to a data record
* Multiple cursors can be active at once
* Used to iterate over data tables

</script></section>







<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## 15 minute break

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## IndexedDB

* Most powerful data-base available to browsers
  * Standardized, works in all modern browsers
  * Can store more than just strings (actually it has its own [serialization system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm))
  * Transactions, cursors, indices
  * Supports DB upgrades
  * Asynchronous interface (use [idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) to enable `await`)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Why transactions in a browser?

* Only one person is accessing the DB at a time, why worry about transactions?
  * If browser is closed/crashes, atomic transactions prevent partial writes
  * User may have your site open in 2 tabs
  * You may have multiple async callbacks on your page
  * Service workers are browser "background processes"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Create a DB

    const dbPromise = idb.openDB('databaseName', 1, {
        upgrade(db) {
            let store = db.createObjectStore('storeName', {
                            keyPath: 'id',
                            autoIncrement: true,
                        });

            store.createIndex('indexName', 'indexField');
        }
    });

* This creates an store inside a DB
* `autoIncrement`: `id` primary key is set to next available number 
* `idb` wraps everything in promises

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Add item to DB

    let db = await dbPromise;
    let tx = db.transaction('storeName', 'readwrite');

    tx.store.add({
        indexField: "...",
    });

    await tx.done;

* `await dbPromise` returns the DB, when ready
* Create a new `readwrite` transaction for store `storeName`, and add item (no `id` required, because autoincrement)
* Commit transaction

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Get all items in a store

    let db = await dbPromise;
    let items = await db.getAll('storeName');

* Return a big array of all items
* Not efficient if you have many items

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Get all with certain index value 

    let db = await dbPromise;
    let items = await db.getAllFromIndex(
                          'storeName',
                          'indexName',
                          value
                      );

* Uses an index, so much more efficient than looping over all items in store

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Update an item

    let db = await dbPromise;
    let tx = db.transaction('storeName', 'readwrite');

    let item = await db.get('storeName', id);
    item.field = 'new value';
